This repo provides Latex source for materials related to nuclear
physics, specifically related to three courses offered at MIT's
nuclear science and engineering department:

- 22.101 Applied nuclear physics: basic quantum mechanics and modern
physics material, extending into nuclear structure, nucleon-nucleon
scattering, radioactive decay, and neutron interactions.

- 22.106 Neutron interactions: neutron transport theory, starting from
  cross-sections and R-matrix theory, and covering the
  differential-integral and integral form of the transport equation,
  Monte Carlo, CPM, MOC, SN, PN methods.

- 22.211 Nuclear reactor physics I: slowing down equation with
  emphasis on resonance treatment and self-shielding treatment,
  spectral calculation, diffusion theory, point kinetics, nodal
  diffusion theory (CMFD, NEM, ANM, SANM), homogenization and
  de-homogenization.

If you just want the pdfs, visit www.mit.edu/~lululi

If you want to compile the Latex source, you'd need the Latex styles
included in the /latex folder.
