\topic{Basics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Common units, see Table~\ref{units}.
\begin{table}

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
   $\sigma$ & $\Sigma$ & $\phi = nv$ & $R = \phi \Sigma$  \\ \hline
   $\cm^2$ & $1/\cm$ & $\frac{n}{\cm^2 \s}$ & $\frac{\mathrm{reactions}}{\cm^3 \s}$ \\ \hline

\item Fast flux in hydrogen is around $10^{14}$ n/cm$^2$s, and on the order of $10^{12}$n/cm$^2$s for thermal flux. 
\item Average fission neutron energy: 2 MeV; average peak fission energy: 1 MeV; see fission sepctrum. 
\item Core decay heat after 1 day is about 1\% rated. 
\item Constants to know: 1u = 931.5 MeV. 
\item The effect of U238 energy self-shielding is about an effect of 10, that is, going from infinite dilution to U/I = 0.1. 
\end{enumerate}

\topic{Cross Section}
\begin{enumerate}
\item* If the neutron cross section is independent of energy at 0K, at 1200K the cross section would have a 1/v energy shape because of thermal motion. 
  
\item* Resonance absorption cross section dominates resonance scattering cross section most of the time (except U238). 

\item* Fission cross section: U235 fission xs at 0.1 eV and 300K is about 200 barns (200-300 barns); Pu239 fission xs is about 475 barns (380-570 barns). Hence in thermal reactors, Pu absorption should be about twice that of uranium. 

\item Elastic scattering cross section as in Figure~\ref{scatter-xs}

\item Capture cross section as in Figure~\ref{capture-xs}:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item H has no resonance; it has the highest scattering xs in LWR, so we can ignore any other isotopic's neutron scattering.   
  \item Na has a huge resonance in 23 keV, and more resonances at higher energies because it is a heavy isotope.
  \item Near zero energy,
    \eqn{ \sigma(E\to 0) \propto \sqrt{\frac{kT}{AE}}    }
  \item Resonance at 6 to 7 eV: U238. 
  \item U235's thermal elastic xs is larger than 238's, and they both have resonance around the same range.   
  \item A small resonance at .3 eV: Pu239 (its signiture is a super low energy scattering xs). 
  \end{enumerate}

\item Given an unknown material type, all we care is to count the nucleus density of each material and look at it's xs. 
\end{enumerate}

\topic{Kinetics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item PWR 300 pcm/K (Lec10 p. 17, FIXME). 

\item One Group $\kinf$: in one group $k_{\infty}$ only depends on cross sections $k_{\infty} = \frac{\nu \Sigma_f}{\Sigma_a}$ and has no flux dependency. The flux is buried in the calculation of cross section.

\item Two group $\kinf$: we start with neutron balance equation:
  \begin{align}
    \frac{\nu \Sigma_{f1}}{k_{\infty}} \Phi_1 - \Sigma_{a1} \Phi_1 - \Sigma_{s12} \Phi_1 + \frac{\nu \Sigma_{f2}}{k_{\infty}} \Phi_2 + \Sigma_{s21} \Phi_2 &= 0 \\
\Sigma_{s12} \Phi_1 - \Sigma_{s21} \Phi_2 - \Sigma_{a2} \Phi_2 &= 0 
  \end{align}
  Typically what we do is to write it in a matrix form and solve for a coupled system. But even better, we can define the \hi{effective removal rate} $\bar{\Sigma}_{s12}$, and re-write the two-group balance equation: 
  \begin{align}
    \frac{\nu \Sigma_{f1}}{k_{\infty}} \Phi_1 - \Sigma_{a1} \Phi_1 - \bar{\Sigma}_{s12} \Phi_1 + \frac{\nu \Sigma_{f2}}{k_{\infty}} \Phi_2 &= 0 \\
    \bar{\Sigma}_{s12} \Phi_1- \Sigma_{a2} \Phi_2 &= 0 
  \end{align}
  Then we can solve for $\frac{\Phi_1}{\Phi_2}$ from the second equation in terms of cross section, plug in the first equation, and get $k_{\infty}$ from there. Notice that we only know the relative magnitude of $\Phi$ and $\Phi_2$. 

\item Two-group, know $D_1 = 1.5, D_2 = 0.5$. Know Two-group diffusion model on p.26 in Lec11 [FIXME].  

\item Know how the solution forms on p. 18 Lec 11. 
\end{enumerate}
