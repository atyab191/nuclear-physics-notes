\topic{Temperature Effects on Cross Section (Doppler Broadening)}
We introduce \hi{Resonance Integrals} as flux-weighted micro-scopic cross section:
\eqn{ \mathrm{RI} = \frac{\int_{E_1}^{E_2} \sigma_{238} (E) \phi(E) \dE}{\int_{E_1}^{E_2} \phi (E) \dE }  }
where in our case $\phi (E) = \frac{1}{E}$ for now, so we can use resonance integrals 

As the \hi{Dilution Factor (U/H)} goes to zero, we get infinite dilution, which is about a factor of 10 or 20 times bigger than a real dilute in a reactor. As the dilution factor goes up, that is, approaching real case, the U238 increases, there are more dips in the flux vs. lethargy plot from U238's resonance xs. 

Resonance Integrals increase with increasing temperature. \hi{Doppler Broadening} comes down to, as the width of the spectrum increases, even if the area under the curve stays the same, the probability of neutron slowing down increases.

\lecture{Facts For Qualify Exam}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Flux = $\frac{n}{\cm^2 \s}.$

\item Fast flux in hydrogen is around $10^{14}$ n/cm$^2$s, and on the order of $10^{12}$n/cm$^2$s for thermal flux. 

\item Capture cross-section as in Figure~\ref{capture-xs}:

\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item H has no resonance; it has the highest scattering xs in LWR, so we can ignore any other isotopic's neutron scattering.   
\item Na has a huge resonance in 23 keV, and more resonances at higher energies because it is a heavy isotope.
\item Near zero energy,
\eqn{ \sigma(E\to 0) = }
\item Resonance at 6 to 7 eV: U238. 
\item U235's thermal elastic xs is larger than 238's, and they both have resonance around the same range.   
\item A small resonance at .3 eV: Pu239 (its signiture is a super low energy scattering xs). 
\end{enumerate}

\item Given an unknown material type, all we care is to count the nucleus density of each material and look at it's xs. 
\item Average fission neutron energy: 2 MeV; average peak fission energy: 1 MeV; see fission sepctrum. 
\end{enumerate}
