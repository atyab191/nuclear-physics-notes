Know how to interprete thermal scattering pdf and cdf. Questions would be based on understanding of the physics. 
\topic{Part 1: Background Info (see Ch 1-3 from Reuss)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Number Density, flux, lethargy.  
\item Mean free path
\item 1/v absorption cross section: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Wave-particle duality suggests that slow neutrons see a larger portion of space than fast neutrons, which means that slow neutrons often have larger cross sections, which leads to the 1/v rule for absorption (Reuss, 2.4.1). 
  \item Reason: Breit-Wigner states that absorption cross section is ($i = \gamma$ for radiative capture and $f$ for fission etc):
    \eqn{ \sigma_i = \pi \bar{\lambda}^2 g \frac{\Gamma_n \Gamma_i}{(E - E_0)^2 + \Gamma^2/4}  }
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\Gamma_f, \Gamma_{\gamma}, \Gamma_{\alpha}$ etc are independent to energy E; $\Gamma_n \sim \sqrt{E}$ (for s-wave);
    \item $\bar{\lambda}^2 \sim \frac{1}{E}$;
    \item The denominator is approximately equal to the constant $E_0^2$ assuming that $E, \Gamma$ are small compared to $E_0$.
    \end{itemize}
    Thus $\sigma_f, \sigma_c \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{E}} \sim \frac{1}{v}$. Even if several resonances make a contribution, the reasoning remains valid. This reasoning is not valid if $E_0$ is close to zero. 
  \item Henry (p. 202) has a derivation for why $\sigma_a(E_r) \approx \frac{1}{v_r}$, but it is using Breit-Wigner for resonance xs. 
  \end{itemize}
\item 1/E spectrum: true except when resonant absorber is present (recall we keep using 1/E for spectrum above the resonance). 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It is characteristic of the scalar flux in the slowing down energy range, as long as there is no up-scattering and no fission source. 
  \item It arises basically from the kinematics of the scattering interaction (asymptotic elastic scattering, more specifically). However it gets distorted by the energy behavior of the scattering cross sections and by neutron-absorption processes (Henry, p. 90). 
  \item Stacy (p.103) derives from slowing-down equation that, with Hydorgen as the only moderator, and very heavy nuclei with $\alpha_j = \left(\frac{A-1}{A+1} \right)^2$:
    \begin{align}
      \Sigma_t(E) \Phi(E) &= \int_E^{\infty} \Sigma_s^H \Phi(E')\frac{\dE'}{E} + \Sum_{j\neq H} \int_E^{E/\alpha_j} \frac{\Sigma_s^j (E') \Phi(E')}{E'(1-\alpha_j)} \dE' \\
      &=  \int_E^{\infty} \Sigma_s^H \Phi(E')\frac{\dE'}{E} + \Sum_{j\neq H} \frac{1}{\alpha_j} \Sigma_s^j (E) \Phi(E) \\
      \left[ \Sigma_a (E) + \Sigma_s^H \right] \Phi(E) &= \int_E^{\infty} \Sigma_s^H \frac{\Phi(E')}{E'} \dE' \\
      \phi(E) &= \frac{(\Sigma_a (E_1) + \Sigma_s^H) E_1 \Phi (E_1) }{(\Sigma_a(E) + \Sigma_s^H) E} \exp{ - \int_E^{E_1} \frac{\Sigma_a (E') \dE'}{(\Sigma_a(E') + \Sigma_s^H) E'} }
    \end{align} 
    suggesting that the neutron energy distribution varies with energy as $\Phi(E) \sim \frac{1}{(\Sigma_a(E) + \Sigma_s^H) E}$. 
  \end{itemize}
\item Maxwellian shapes.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Fission emission spectrum: peak occurs at 1.7 MeV, average occurs at 2 MeV.
  \item Thermal flux spectrum: for an infintie source-free medium with small absorption cross section (as long as $\Sigma_a(E)$ is small compare to $\Sigma_s(E)$), the thermal spectrum is Maxwellian. The higher energy portion of the thermal region is approximately 1/E with slowing down source and absorption present (Henry, p.98). Stacy (p. 109) provides a more detailed reasoning for why neutron energy distribution in the thermal range can be approximately by Maxwellian distribution: the neutron balance equation in the thermal energy range is, 
    \eqn{ \Sigma_t(E) \phi(E) = \int_0^{E_{th}} \Sigma_s (E' \to E) \phi(E') \dE' + S(E) }
    For the thermal range, we assume no absorption $\Sigma_a(E)$ and no slowing-down source $S(E)$, and we extend the upper limit on the integral to infinity under the assumption that the scattering to energies greater than $E_{th}$ is zero; then the neutron flux balance is,
    \eqn{ \Sigma_s (E) \phi(E) = \int_0^{\infty} \Sigma_s (E' \to E) \phi(E') \dE' }
   It can be shown that a Maxwellian distribution satisfies the above equation. However, absorption, leakage and a slowing-down source would distort the actual spectrum from a Maxwellian. Since most absorption xs vary as 1/v, absorption preferentially removes lower-energy neutrons, effectively shifting the spectrum to higher energies than a Maxwellian at the moderator temperature T. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\topic{Part 2: Physical components of Monte Carlo code} see Table~\ref{plot-MC}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Elastic scattering:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Asymptotic elastic scattering for high energy (above 4eV): assume isotropic scattering in COM. Generate 1/E spectrum; asymptotic flux value is $\Phi_{as} (u) = \frac{S}{\xi \Sigma_s (u)}$ according to Reuss (7.2.3). 
  \item Thermal elastic scattering (below 4eV): use elastic scattering for monatomic (Maxwellian) free gas; may up-scatter;
  \end{enumerate}
\item Simple bound thermal scattering: 
  \eqn{ \sigma_{\mbox{bound}} = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{A_{\mathrm{atom}}} \right) \sigma_{\mathrm{free}} }
\item SLBW resonance models
\item Doppler broadening: when temperature increases, the width of the spectrum decreases, meaning the peak decreases and the distribution spreads out. 
\item Monte Carlo tallies: need enough to provide resolution, but not too many that each bin does not get enough particles. 
\item Resonance integrals: 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item RI represents the average absorption xs characterizing the resonance, averaged over the flux within the resonance. It is sort of like the averaged reaction rate, or collision density. Definition:
    \eqn{ \RIeff = - \int_{u1}^{u2} \sigma(u) \du = \int_{E_1}^{E_2} \sigma(E) \frac{1}{E} \dE }
  \item Relating to $\sigma_g, \sigma_d$: 
    \eqn{ \RIeff &= \sigma_g \ln{\frac{E_2}{E_1}}  & \RIeff^{u1\to u2} &= \int_{u1}^{u2} \sigma_a^R (u) \frac{\sigma_d}{\sigma_a^R(u) + \sigma_d} \du  }
  \item As temperature increases, $\RIeff$ increases becasue the broadened resonance increases the energy range over which abosprtion occurs. There is less flux depression, whereas the area under the cross section is about the save, result in an increase in the $\RIeff$.
  \item As U/H increases, $\RIeff$ decreases because of energy self-shielding: as U/H increases, more and more self-shielding, the flux is more depressed, result in smaller $\RIeff$. A second consequence is that the higher energy range becomes more important. See Section~\ref{spectral-hardening-section}. 
\end{enumerate}
\item Group cross sections: the contribution of the resonance to a flux-weighted multigroup cross section for reaction type $\gamma$:
  \eqn{ \sigma_{\gamma}^g = \frac{\int_{E_g}^{E_{g-1}} \sigma_{\gamma} (E) \phi(E) \dE}{\int_{E_g}^{E_{g-1}} \phi(E) \dE}  }
  Assume $\phi \sim \frac{1}{E}$,
  \eqn{ \sigma_g = \frac{\RI_{\eff}}{\ln(E_2/E_1)} = \frac{\Sum_{i \in g} RI_i }{\ln{\frac{E_{g-1}}{E_g} }}   }
\item Background (dilution) cross section $\sigma_d$: notice the $\sigma_m$ there is most likely to be scattering xs,
  \eqn{ \sigma_d = \frac{N_m}{N_r} \sigma_m  }
\item Narrow vs. wide resonance models
\item Resonance escape probability $p$: only depends on effective RI and dilution xs: 
\eqn{ \boxed{ p \approx \exp \left( - \frac{\RI_{\eff}}{\zeta \sigma_d} \right) = \exp \left( - \frac{N_r \RI_{\eff}}{\zeta \Sigma_m} \right)  } }
\item Homogeneous/heterogeneous equivalence: 
  \begin{align*}
    \mbox{Homogeneous mixture energy shape of flux } \phi(u) &= \frac{\sigma_{pot, f} + \sigma_d}{\sigma_{r,f} (u) + \sigma_{pot, f} + \sigma_d}   & \sigma_d &= \frac{N_m \sigma_m}{N_r}  \\
    \mbox{Heterogeneous energy shape of flux in the fuel } \phi_f(u) &= \frac{\sigma_{pot, f} + \sigma_e}{\sigma_{r,f} (u) + \sigma_{pot, f} + \sigma_e}   & \sigma_e &= \frac{S_f}{4 V_f N_r} 
  \end{align*}
\item Escape cross section $\sigma_e$: 
\eqn{ \sigma_e = \frac{1}{l N_f} = \frac{S}{4V N_f} }
\item 2-region reciprocity relation:
\eqn{ P_{1\to 2} \Sigma_1 V_1 = P_{2\to 1} \Sigma_2 V_2 }
\item Dancoff factors.
\end{enumerate}

\topic{Part 3: Other important concepts}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Self-shielding: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \item 
  \end{itemize}
\item Slowing down equations. 
\item Review of spectrum:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A hump in high energy. Reason: fission spectrum, degraded due to scattering; 
      \item A slight decrease in the epithermal region. Reason: resonant capture losses, esp. U238; 
      \item A hump in low energy. Reason: Maxwell distribution of the thermal agitation but a little harder because the temperature equilibrium has not been perfectly achieved. 
    \end{enumerate}
\item More spectrum: 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $E > 0.5$ MeV: $\phi(E) = \frac{\chi(E)}{\Sigma_t(E)}$.
  \item $1 \eV < E < 50$ keV (slowing-down domain): $\phi(E) \sim \frac{1}{\xi(E) \Sigma_t(E) E}$. 
  \item $E < 1$ eV (thermal range): a hardened Maxwellian distribution (hardened because the temperature equilibrium has not been perfectly achieved) plus a 1/E correction at higher energies, $\phi(E) = \phi_M (E, T_n) + \frac{ \lambda \Delta (E/kT_n) }{E}$. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\topic{Concepts I got wrong in Exam 1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 1/v cross section shape due to thermal motion. [2]
\item Thermal scattering kernel: notice for symmetry; know how to go from pdf to cdf etc. [1]
\item Resonance Integral: only include the resonance cross section, not the potential cross section. [2]
\item Infinite dilute implies that here is no neutrons being absorbed by the resonances. Recall that in HW2 when our U/H is small, the flux is not perturbed by U238 resonances at all, suggesting that the resonance escape probability is one. [1]
\item Calculate effective RI through $\RIeff = \int \sigma_r \phi \frac{1}{E} \dE.$ There is no integration of flux on the bottom (only introduced group xs's definition for the simulation's purpose). [2]
\item Calculate probabilities in 2 region setup. [3]
\item Monte Carlo tallies: U238 absorption rate can be estimated as $\Sum \frac{\Sigma_a}{\Sigma_t}$, the U238 absorption rate per atom is $\Sum \frac{\sigma_a}{\Sigma_t}$. [2]
