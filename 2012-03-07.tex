\topic{HW4: Real Application of Resonance Model}



\lecture{Exam 1 Review}
Know how to interprete thermal scattering pdf and cdf. 

Questions would be based on understanding of the physics. 

Part 1: Background Info (see Ch 1-3 from Reuss)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Number Density
\item Flux
\item Lethargy
\item Mean free path
\item 1/v, 1/E.
\item Maxwellian shapes.
\end{enumerate}


Part 2: physical components of Monte Carlo code:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Asymptotic elastic scattering
\item Maxwellian thermal elastic scattering
\item Simple bound thermal scattering
\item SLBW resonance models
\item Doppler broadening
\item Monte Carlo tallies
\item Resonance integrals vs. group cross sections
\item Background (dilution) cross section
\item Narrow vs. wide resonance models
\item Resonance escape probability
\item Homogeneous/heterogeneous equivalence
\item Escape cross sections
\item 2-region reciprocity relation
\item Dancoff factors.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Flux = $\frac{n}{\cm^2 \s}.$

\item Fast flux in hydrogen is around $10^{14}$ n/cm$^2$s, and on the order of $10^{12}$n/cm$^2$s for thermal flux. 

\item U235 fission xs at 0.1 eV is about 200 barns; Pu239 fission xs is about 500 barns. In thermal reactors, Pu absorption should be about twice that of uranium. 

\item Capture cross-section as in Figure~\ref{capture-xs}:

\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item H has no resonance; it has the highest scattering xs in LWR, so we can ignore any other isotopic's neutron scattering.   
\item Na has a huge resonance in 23 keV, and more resonances at higher energies because it is a heavy isotope.
\item Near zero energy,
\eqn{ \sigma(E\to 0) = }
\item Resonance at 6 to 7 eV: U238. 
\item U235's thermal elastic xs is larger than 238's, and they both have resonance around the same range.   
\item A small resonance at .3 eV: Pu239 (its signiture is a super low energy scattering xs). 
\end{enumerate}

\item Given an unknown material type, all we care is to count the nucleus density of each material and look at it's xs. 
\item Average fission neutron energy: 2 MeV; average peak fission energy: 1 MeV; see fission sepctrum. 

\item Core decay heat after 1 day is about 1\% rated.
