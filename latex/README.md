latex-style: latex style sheets defining shortcut terms for physics
and nuclear engineering; page style setup for notes, homeworks etc

Examples of notes, homeworks and exam solutions written using these
styles can be found at www.mit.edu/~lululi under "Lecture Notes"
Section.

The most useful files are the following:
1. Defining common engineering and science shortcuts:
    * school-style-derivitives.sty: shorthands for common derivatives in
      physics and nuclear engineering;
    * school-style-math.sty: shorthands for common terms in physics and nuclear
      engineering;
    * school-style-units.sty: shorthands for common units

2. Defining page styles for applications like lecture notes, homeworks, exams,
   and thesis:
    * school-style-classnotes.sty: lecture notes;
    * school-style-homework.sty: homeworks;
    * school-style-researchnotes.sty: plain style for research notes;
    * school-style-exam.sty: exam solutions;
    * mitthesis.cls: MIT thesis style for course 22 MS thesis

3. Setting up styles for an individual class: there are typically three .cls
   files (where classcode is replaced by the actual code of the class):
    * school-classcode.cls: defines basic class info like class code number,
      name, professor name, school;
    * school-classcode-notes.cls: calls school-classcode.cls and
      school-style-classnotes.sty;
    * school-classcode-homework.cls: calls school-classcode.cls and
      school-style-homework.sty.
